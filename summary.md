# Weekly Summary: File Uploader (2025-07-15 to 2025-07-22)

## High-Level Summary

The past week has seen a significant push towards production-readiness for the File Uploader service. The primary focus has been on refining the AWS infrastructure, improving configuration, and enhancing the CI/CD pipeline. The project has moved from a functional application to a more robust, deployable, and maintainable service.

## Key Changes This Week

### Infrastructure and Deployment (Terraform & CI/CD)

*   **Terraform Enhancements:**
    *   **Resource Configuration:** Improved the configuration of various AWS resources, including more granular IAM policies and optimized ECS task definitions.
    *   **Load Balancer Lifecycle:** Addressed a lifecycle issue with the Application Load Balancer to prevent unintended resource recreation.
    *   **IAM Policy Attachments:** Fixed an issue with attaching IAM policies to the correct roles.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Improvements:**
    *   **Integration Wait Time:** Increased the wait time in the CI pipeline to allow for slower AWS resource provisioning, preventing premature test failures.
    *   **ECS Deployment Logic:** Updated the CI/CD pipeline to correctly update the ECS service with the new task definition on each deployment.
    *   **Test Re-integration:** Re-included unit and integration tests in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.

### Application and Codebase

*   **Configuration and Error Handling:**
    *   **Improved Configuration:** Enhanced the application's configuration loading and error handling, making it more resilient.
    *   **Port Assignment:** Fixed a port assignment issue that was causing failures in the production environment.
*   **Context Propagation:**
    *   **Refactored `context.Context`:** Propagated `context.Context` throughout the application, from the HTTP handlers down to the storage layer. This is a crucial improvement for handling timeouts, cancellations, and tracing.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   Addressed various bugs related to AWS region configuration, environment variable parsing, and secret handling in GitHub Actions.

### Documentation

*   **`CODE_REVIEW.md` Updated:** The code review document was updated to reflect the latest changes and provide a more current assessment of the project's status.
*   **`documentation.md` Updated:** The main documentation was updated to include details about the S3 integration, Terraform infrastructure, and the CI/CD pipeline.

## Analysis and Understanding

The changes this week demonstrate a clear focus on maturing the project from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready service. The developer has shown a strong ability to diagnose and fix issues related to cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and application configuration.

The refactoring of `context.Context` propagation is a particularly important improvement, as it demonstrates an understanding of best practices for building scalable and resilient Go applications. The continuous refinement of the Terraform and CI/CD configurations shows a commitment to infrastructure as code and automation.

The project is now in a much stronger position for a stable and reliable deployment. The focus on documentation ensures that the project is maintainable and understandable for other developers.
