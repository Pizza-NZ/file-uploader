# Code Review: File Uploader

## High-Level Summary

This is a great start for a junior-level project. It demonstrates a good understanding of Go, Docker, and basic API design. The code is clean, well-structured, and the `README.md` is clear. The use of a `makefile` and a CI/CD pipeline is a nice touch.

## Pros

*   **Clear Project Structure:** The project is well-organized into packages with clear responsibilities (`handlers`, `services`, `middleware`, etc.). This makes the code easy to navigate and understand.
*   **Good Use of Go Features:** The code uses interfaces, structs, and packages effectively. The `main.go` file shows a good understanding of graceful shutdown, which is crucial for production services.
*   **Dockerization:** The use of Docker and `docker-compose` is a huge plus. It shows you're thinking about deployment and reproducibility.
*   **Testing:** The inclusion of unit and integration tests is excellent. This is a key skill for any software engineer.
*   **CI/CD:** The GitHub Actions workflow is a great addition. It shows you understand the importance of automated testing and builds.
*   **Structured Logging:** The use of `slog` is a good choice. Structured logging is essential for debugging and monitoring applications in production.

## Cons & Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Configuration Management

*   **Hardcoded Values:** The `maxFileSize` in `handlers.go` is hardcoded. This should be configurable, ideally through environment variables or a configuration file. This makes the application more flexible and easier to manage in different environments.
*   **File Storage Path:** The `tempFolderPath` in `services.go` is hardcoded. This should also be configurable. What if you want to store files in a different location, like an S3 bucket?

**Recommendation:** Use a library like [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) to manage configuration. This will allow you to load configuration from environment variables, a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`), or both.

#### 2. Error Handling

*   **Generic Error Messages:** The error messages in `services.go` are a bit generic (e.g., "Internal Server Error"). While you're logging the specific error, the user gets a vague message. It's a good practice to provide more specific error messages when possible, without revealing sensitive information.
*   **Error Wrapping:** You're creating new `AppError` types, which is good. However, you could also wrap the original error to preserve the stack trace. This is helpful for debugging.

**Recommendation:** Use `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb to wrap errors. This will give you more context when you're debugging.

#### 3. Security

*   **File Type Validation:** The application doesn't seem to validate the file type. A malicious user could upload a harmful file (e.g., an executable).
*   **Resource Limits:** While you have a `maxFileSize`, you should also consider other resource limits, like the number of concurrent uploads. This can help prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Recommendation:**

*   Implement file type validation based on the file's magic number, not just the extension.
*   Consider adding a rate limiter to the API endpoints.

#### 4. Code Duplication

*   **Root Path Calculation:** The `RootPath` calculation in `services.go` is a bit fragile. It relies on the location of the `services.go` file. This could break if you refactor the code.

**Recommendation:** Pass the root path as a dependency to the `FileUploadService`. This will make the service more self-contained and easier to test.

#### 5. Concurrency

*   **No Locking:** The `CreateFileUpload` function in `services.go` doesn't use any locking when creating the temporary folder. If two requests come in at the same time and the folder doesn't exist, you could have a race condition.

**Recommendation:** Use a `sync.Once` or a mutex to ensure the temporary folder is created only once.

### Things to Watch Out For

*   **Scalability:** This implementation stores files on the local filesystem. This won't scale if you have multiple instances of the application running behind a load balancer. For a production system, you'd want to use a distributed file storage solution like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or MinIO.
*   **Temporary File Cleanup:** The application creates temporary files but doesn't seem to have a mechanism for cleaning them up. You should consider adding a background job that periodically cleans up old temporary files.
*   **Testing:** While you have tests, you could improve them by using a testing framework like `testify` to make your assertions more readable. You could also add more test cases to cover edge cases.

### Next Steps for Your Roadmap

1.  **Refactor Configuration:** Move all hardcoded values to a configuration file or environment variables.
2.  **Improve Error Handling:** Use error wrapping and provide more specific error messages.
3.  **Add Security Features:** Implement file type validation and rate limiting.
4.  **Address Concurrency Issues:** Use a mutex to prevent race conditions.
5.  **Explore Distributed File Storage:** Read up on how to integrate with a service like MinIO or AWS S3. This is a key skill for backend and DevOps engineers.
6.  **Improve Testing:** Use a testing framework and add more test cases.
